# youtime

A Chrome Extension that can monitor users' YouTube watch time.

- Records time whenever users pause the video, jump to another video, or leave current window.
- Sends the record (including watch time and category) to backend ([watch_history](https://github.com/mangosteen20/watch_history)) each time.
- Displays three longest categories' watch time by requesting data from backend.
